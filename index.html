    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><img src="./assets/images/photoId.jpg" alt="Photo">I was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United States 
    in 1990. Graduated high school in Whittier, received my Finance degree from Cal State Fullerton and currently pursuing an MBA in International Business. </p>
    <p>Although my background is in Finance, I've always had an interest in technology. I am the Business System Manager at a manufacturing
        company in southern California. We employ around 300 people and I am incharge of all IT related infrastructure within the company along with system 
        integration and user training across all of our platforms including MRP, shop floor data collection and CRM software.</p>
    <p>My hobby includes outdoor activities and traveling. My goal is to take one extended trip each year to somewhere I've never been and
        I am fortunate to have been able to do so. One goal I have in life is for my list of places I've been to be longer than my list of places I've not been, and along the way, have a positive impact on the lives of the people I meet.</p>        
    <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
        certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights
        governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.</p>
